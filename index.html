				Hi there! My name is Leyton, and I'm a video editor, graphic designer, front-end developer and photographer.
				<br></br>
				Unlike many professionals in my field, I didn't attend university. Instead, I'm a self-taught professional who has honed my skills through years of experience and experimentation.
				<br></br>	
				My love for video editing began when I was just a teenager. I started by making videos for fun, but it quickly turned into a passion. I learned how to use different software programs and techniques through trial and error, and eventually, I began taking on clients.
				<br></br>	
				As my video editing skills progressed, I also became interested in graphic design. I taught myself how to use various design software programs and began creating logos, banners, and other visuals for clients.
				<br></br>	
				More recently, I have expanded my skillset to include front-end development. I love being able to bring my designs to life by coding them into functioning websites. Again, I taught myself how to code by reading online tutorials and practising.
				<br></br>	
				Despite not having a formal education, I have been able to build a successful career doing what I love. I take pride in my ability to bring my clients' visions to life, whether it's through a video, a graphic design, or a website.
				<br></br>	
				When I'm not working, you can usually find me watching tutorials to improve my skills or tinkering around with a new project. I'm always looking for new challenges and ways to push myself creatively.
				<br></br>	
				Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. If you have a project in mind, I'd love to chat and see how I can help bring it to life.
